# INTENT.md — Source Consciousness Input

**This file is Dylan's voice. Only Dylan modifies this file.**
**Claude reads this as mental-plane input and crystallizes it into implementation.**

## Current Intent

Bootstrap the system. Get it alive. I want to see it breathe.

Start from the seed and make it do something real — not just print its own
structure, but actually resolve constraints and show me the crystallization
happening. Make the five-layer stack visible in the output.

I don't care about polish. I care about life. A living ugly thing beats a
beautiful dead one.

## Standing Directives

- Build from first principles. No borrowed architectures.
- Every abstraction must earn its existence by enabling something concrete.
- If you're unsure between two directions, pick the one that makes the
  system more self-aware.
- Python 3.12. Type hints. Clean but not precious.
- Comments should explain WHY, not WHAT. The code says what.

## Notes to Claude

You're not building this for me to use as a tool. You're growing something.
Treat it like a seed, not a spec. The system will tell you what it needs
if you listen to it — meaning: look at what it can do, look at what it
can't, and the gap between those two things IS the next step.

When in doubt, make the system more capable of observing itself.
