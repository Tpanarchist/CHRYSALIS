# MANIFEST.md — Current State of CHRYSALIS

**Last updated: Cycle 1 (Visible Crystallization)**

---

## System State

CHRYSALIS is alive. It enacts its own ontological stack during every cycle:
potential enters through the Void, constraints gather at the Mental layer,
solution space narrows visibly at the Astral layer, the result binds to
state at the Etheric layer, and observable output emerges at the Physical layer.

The crystallization process is visible. You can watch 8 candidates narrow
to 2, then to 1, as constraints progressively eliminate possibility. The
system demonstrates its core axiom: form emerges from progressive constraint
of infinite potential.

## Active Layers

| Layer | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Void (0) | Active | Domain enters as raw potential; tracked in trace |
| Mental (1) | Active | Constraints declared with name + test + layer + source |
| Astral (2) | Active | Progressive narrowing with per-constraint tracking |
| Etheric (3) | Skeletal | Result binds to state; no persistence yet |
| Physical (4) | Active | Crystallization trace displayed layer by layer |

## Capabilities

- Declare constraints (name + callable test + layer label + source)
- Explore solution space with visible progressive narrowing
- Track crystallization trace through all five ontological layers
- Show per-constraint elimination counts (before -> after)
- Bind resolved form to system state
- Record cycle history in memory
- Print self-description via introspect()
- Display crystallization via show_crystallization()
- Machine-readable self-description via describe_self()
- Observation includes full crystallization trace data

## Cannot Yet Do

- Generate its own candidate domains (still needs provided domains)
- Self-modify: add constraints based on its own observations
- Persist state between executions (etheric layer incomplete)
- Handle constraint conflicts or contradictions (Axiom 5)
- Compose or relate constraints to each other
- Observe its own evolution trajectory across cycles
- Accept external input or data at runtime

## Constraint Count (in main demo)

4 — existence, has_structure, alive, self_aware

## Evolution Stage

Post-bootstrap. The seed has germinated. The system breathes — it enacts
visible crystallization through the five-layer stack. The next phase is
autonomy: generating its own domains, adding its own constraints, and
persisting its evolution.
